# Vision Practice

Vision practice with opencv, pytorch, tensorflow, tensorrt with C++ and python. Initialy following pyimagesearch university tutorials.
I will be creating more complicated applications.

## How to build and run
Tested under ubuntu 18.04. Requires docker, cmake, gcc, make. 

- `make create_docker` : creates the build and test environment
- `make run` : to run the tests

## Todolist
The check list is connected to pull requests and branch work. Each element has a branch and once completed will be pulled in by a pull request.


### Opencv with C++
- [ ] Translate images using warpaffine
- [ ] Build a base test and create the build-test environment with docker
- [x] Write a todo list
